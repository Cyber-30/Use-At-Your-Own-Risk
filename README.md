## [MATRIX LOCK](https://github.com/Cyber-30/Use-At-Your-Own-Risk/blob/main/matrix_lock.cpp)
A hacker-style C++ terminal animation that brute-forces and locks text characters one by one with Matrix glitch effects.

## [Loopless Ten](https://github.com/Cyber-30/Use-At-Your-Own-Risk/blob/main/loopless_Ten.cpp)
Counts from 1 to 10 using goto instead of loops — a playful nod to old-school C++ style.

## [Popup Storm](https://github.com/Cyber-30/Use-At-Your-Own-Risk/blob/main/Popup_Storm.vbs)
An eternal echo of warnings trapped in a loop of existential alertness.

## [Raster Pulse](https://github.com/Cyber-30/Use-At-Your-Own-Risk/blob/main/raster_pulse.c)
A lightweight terminal workload that continuously reflows character rasters to observe redraw cadence and viewport responsiveness.
